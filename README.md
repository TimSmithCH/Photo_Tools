# Photo_Tools

Tools used to tag photo metadata (people, places, dates) directly in the
 IPTC fields of the JPG or TIFF file.

This is more portable and durable than tagging with photo organosation
 tools which store the info (and therefore lock it in propriatary
 formats) in external databases

These tools were started in 2003 when using PhotoShop on Windows. They
were heavily developed when migrating to Aperture on Mac and throughout
the use of Aperture. And finally were extended in 2020 when migrating
to Photos on Mac
